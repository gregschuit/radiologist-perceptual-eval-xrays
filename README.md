# radiologist-perceptual-eval-xrays
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis for my master's thesis, which explores the generation of synthetic chest X-rays using adversarial (GAN) and diffusion models. The study focuses on the perceptual evaluation of radiologists to assess the quality and diagnostic utility of the generated images.
